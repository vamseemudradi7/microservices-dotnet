"# microservices-dotnet" 

**About the Application**

This application is a cloud-native web platform built using a microservices architecture with .NET. It's designed for scalability, maintainability, and rapid development, leveraging Docker containers and Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration. Each microservice handles a specific business function, enabling independent deployment and updates. The API Gateway (Ocelot/YARP) provides a unified entry point, simplifying client interactions.

**Benefits:**

Scalable: Individual services scale independently.
Maintainable: Smaller, focused services for easier updates.
Resilient: Fault isolation prevents cascading failures.
Flexible: Technology choice per service.
Agile: Faster development and deployment cycles.
Cloud-Native: Optimized for containerized environments.
